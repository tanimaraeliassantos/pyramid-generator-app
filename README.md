# PYRAMID GENERATOR APP

The Pyramid Generator application was built as a practice project for a JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course with FreeCodeCamp. This app allows users to generate a pyramid in the console, specifying the characters, number of rows, and the pyramid's orientation (pointing up or down). Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes arrays, strings, functions, loops, and if/else statements.
